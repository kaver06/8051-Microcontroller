# 8051-Microcontroller
8051 Microcontroller Projects
This repository contains a collection of basic projects using the 8051 microcontroller. All projects are developed in Keil uVision and simulated in Proteus. Each folder includes source code, simulation files, and documentation to help beginners understand 8051 programming and hardware interfacing.

Projects Included:
```
->Interfacing 7-Segment Display
  Display numbers and characters using a 7-segment display with the 8051.
->Interfacing ADC with LCD
  Read analog values using an ADC and display the results on an LCD.
->Interfacing ADC with LED
  Convert analog input to digital and indicate the result using LEDs.
->Interfacing DAC0808
  Generate analog output from digital values using the DAC0808.
->Interfacing LCD
  Display messages and data on an LCD module.
->Interfacing LED
  Basic LED interfacing and control using the 8051 microcontroller.
->Interfacing Stepper Motor
  Control the direction and speed of a stepper motor.
```
